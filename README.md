## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

### What I learned

This project seemed simple on the surface, but it had some challenging aspects to the design. I also learned about incorporating animations and touch control into my React app.

### Continued development

I want to keep going with React for a while so I can learn in thoroughly.

### Useful resources

- [Demaspira Aulia on Dev.to](https://dev.to/rakumairu/how-to-handle-swipe-event-on-react-carousel-24ab) - Alhough I didn't follow this entire example, the section on using touch to swipe left and right through pages was very helpful.
